# Chess

This directory contains a command line version of chess for two players, implemented in Ruby
as the [final assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/ruby-final-project?ref=lnav) from the Ruby Programming section of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com).

To play the game, clone this repo and run `ruby lib/chess.rb`.
